This is a basic linter project created with ruby. The Linter is designed to scan the following errors in any inspected document:

1. He will return each line in wich you are missing a bracket ('[ ]' - '( )' - '{ }').
2. He will return an error if the first line on your file is a blank line.
3. He will return an error if the total lines on your file are bigger than 100.
4. He will return an error if the total lines on a single line are bigger than 120.

This project has been developed to accomplish the Ruby module capstone project at Microverse.
