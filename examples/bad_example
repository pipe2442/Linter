Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor 
at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure 
Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going 
through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered 
the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 
and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of 
Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise o
n the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The fir
st line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes fr
om a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is rep
roduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.
33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also rep
roduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English ve
rsions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
